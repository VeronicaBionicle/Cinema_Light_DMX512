This is my graduate qualification work. It controls LED lighting by DMX512. And has GPIO and Ethernet interfaces and IR-remote control

- Decided to use Mega2560, because it has more external interrupts, GPIOs, Timers and USARTs;
- Tested Arduino four universes DMX 512 library (Toni Merino (C)) and rewrited some vector names to new;
- Uploaded libraries, notes and test pieces to GitHub for convenience.
